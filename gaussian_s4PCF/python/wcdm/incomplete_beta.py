######### An adaptation of the GSL beta function code

def beta_cont_frac_gsl(a, b, x):
    # This computes B_x(a,b) using a continued fraction approximation.
    # We do require a>0, but b can be negative.
    # Having b<0 and x very near 1 can cause of precision (not enough iterations)
    # However, x near 1 only occurs in the far future for our cosmology application
    # Require 0<=x<1.
    #
    # This python subroutine is adapted from the 
    # Gnu Science Library (GSL) specfunc/beta_inc.c code
    # by Daniel Eisenstein (July 2015).
    # Changes were generally to strip down to the case of interest, removing
    # the pre-factor from the complete beta function.  Also vectorized.

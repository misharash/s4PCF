# Python implementation of formulae in Eisenstein (2015).

'''
wcdm(z,om,w):  Compute the proper motion distance in (c/H_0) units.
    Allows vector z, om, and/or w
    Can accept any om>0.
    Requires w<-1/3 if one is using the SciPy beta function, w<0 if using GSL

wcdm_time(z, om, w): Compute t(z) in (1/H_0) units.
    Allows vector z and w
        Requires om<=1, but can accept a vector.
    Use om=0.99999 if you want om=1.
    Requires w<-1 if one is using the SciPy beta function, w<0 if using GSL

owcdm(z,om,w,ok): Compute the comoving coordinate distance and proper motion distance,
    both in (c/H_0) units.
    Allows z, om, or w as vectors; will produce a vector output.
    ok must be a scalar.
    Requires om<1 and ox=1-om-ok>0.
    Use om=0.99999 if you want om=1.
    Requires w<-1/3 if one is using the SciPy beta function, w<0 if using GSL
    The curvature is treated only perturbatively; it will be fine for |Ok|<0.1,
    but will start to produce noticeable offsets for Ok ~ Om.

coorddist(z, om, w, ok): owcdm() driver for comoving coordinate distance
propmotdis(z, om, w, ok): owcdm() driver for proper motion distance
angdist(z, om, w, ok): owcdm() driver for angular diameter distance
lumdist(z, om, w, ok): owcdm() driver for luminosity distance

wcdm_rad(z, om, w, rad=0.0): Compute the proper motion distance in (c/H_0) units,
    including an approximation for radiation terms.
    Allows vector z, om, and/or w.
    Can accept 0<om<1.
        Requires w<-1/3 if one is using the SciPy beta function, w<0 if using GSL
    This uses the beta functions with arguments that may not be allowed in
    all implementations, but appears to work for the GSL code.

test(): Produces a set of accuracy tests relative to numerical evaluation
    of the integrals being used.
